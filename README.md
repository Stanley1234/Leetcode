#### How to use the Leetcode crawler

The crawler needs authentication to be able to scrape submissions from the website.
Authentication information is stored in `.leetcode-auth`, where the first line is the
username and the second line is the password in plain text.

Then the crawler will scrape all accepted submissions, and, per question and code language, 
it downloads the solution from the website and records the submission to `readme_generated.md`.

The file `.synced_questions` saves the title (not `title_slug`) of the question already scraped.
This is useful when scraper stops before completion so that all questions already scraped will generate 
a `readme`, and all these questions will not be scraped next time.
